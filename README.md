# WinFrag

WinFrag is a simple utility for fragmenting Windows filesystems. Currently confirmed to work on NTFS.

**Warning!** This utility **might slow your disk down**. To undo fragmentation, remove the `WinFrag` folder from the target disk.

# Usage

Simply run `winfrag.bat`!

# Settings

You can change target drive letter and file count in `winfrag.cfg`.  
Higher file count will cause more fragmentation but it will also take more time to complete.
